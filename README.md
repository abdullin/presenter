presenter
=========

Send LEFT and RIGHT keystrokes to your OSX from any device on the same network



In order to start the tool: `go run main.go` in presenter directory. It will launch a web server on port `8080`.

If you open then `DESKTOPIP:8080/index.html` in any mobile device, connected to the same network, you'll have a simple web UI allowing you to emulate pressing `LEFT` and `RIGHT` on your desktop.
